# AI Study Companion

This is my first AI project.  
It will read my university PDFs and answer questions in simple language.

## Goals
- Learn Python step by step.
- Build a small tool that answers questions from PDF files.
- Improve it later with a simple app.

## Planned Folders
- rag → main code
- data → my PDFs
- notebooks → first experiments
- ui → app later
- tests → check code
